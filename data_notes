DESCRIPTION:
Some notes from looking at scatterplots of each variable vs the target variable, as well as histograms/distributions of each variable.

Utilities:
Only one value is present in the training dataset. Likely drop.

Condition2:
One value holds vast majority. Likely drop.

MSSubClass:
Useful as a categorical, but need to convert to string first. Default type is int64.

-----------------------------------
*OverallQual:
Power transformation might be appropriate. maybe ^2

MasVnrArea:
Weakly positive. Would require a lot of nan filling work.

BsmtFinSF1:
Power relationship. Would require nan filling.

*TotalBsmtSF:
Good candidate. Would need a power fit.

1stFlrSF:
Good candidate. Would need a power fit. Probably redundant with GrLivArea.

2ndFlrSF:
Moderate positive correlation, linear fit. Lots of zero values that I'm not quite sure how to deal with. Probably redundant with GrLivArea.

*GrLivArea:
Good candidate as-is for linear fit.

*FullBath:
Only 4 possible values, but I think a linear fit would work fine.

TotRmsAbvGrd:
Good candidate. Linear fit.

GarageYrBlt:
Positive correlation. Probably require exp fit. Not sure how to deal with zeros.

GarageCars:
Good candidate. Linear fit.

*GarageArea:
Probably redundant to GarageCars. Linear fit ok, even with zeros. Pick one or other.

MoSold:
Could be useful. Likely not much overlap with other vars. Unsure of fit.

^2 fit candidates:
